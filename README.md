### Objective
To create a comprehensive Sales Dashboard that enables detailed analysis of sales data across various sub-categories, customers, and regions. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as sales by sub-category, profit trends over time, top-performing customers, statewise sales, customer count across years, and monthly sales.

### Tools Used

* Excel(PivotTables, Slicers, Data Visualizations)
* Bar Charts, Line Charts, Pie Charts, Maps
* Report Connections for Slicers

### Process:
**1. Sales by Sub-Categories:**
   * A bar chart visualizes the sales data by different sub-categories like Phones, Chairs, and Storage.
   * Phones and chairs emerged as the top two sub-categories with sales over 300,000.

**2. Profit Gained Over Time:**
   * A line chart shows profit trends for Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology from 2014 to 2017.
   * All three categories show a steady increase, with Technology leading the gains.

**3. Top 5 Profit-Making Customers:**

* A pie chart displays the top 5 customers contributing the most to profits.
* Tamara Chand leads with 27%, followed by Raymond Buch and Sanjit Chand.

**4. Statewise Sales:**

* A map visualization provides insights into sales performance across different states.
* The highest sales were recorded in California with over 457,000, while some states registered under 1,000.

**5. Customer Count Over the Years:**

* A bar chart reveals customer growth from 2014 to 2017, with a clear increase each year.
* The customer count peaked in 2017 with 693 customers.

**6. Monthly Sales:**

* A line chart represents the monthly sales trend, with significant fluctuations but overall positive performance through the year.

**7. Slicers:**

* The dashboard includes slicers for Category and Year that allow users to filter and explore specific segments of data dynamically.

### Results:

* The interactive filters enable users to drill down into specific data points for more detailed insights.
* The visualizations provide a clear and concise summary of key business performance indicators, helping decision-makers identify growth opportunities and high-performing areas.
